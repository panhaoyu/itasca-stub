# itasca-stub

This repository contains code to generate `itasca.pyi` for PFC600.

Itasca provide Python interface,
however, I want to write Python in Pycharm.
Itasca does not provide Pycharm interface,
So when I write PFC in Pycharm,
the keyword `itasca` is always red,
and there's no type hint.

I wrote these code to generate `itasca.pyi`.
If you want to use it,
just copy the `itasca.pyi` to `site-packages`.

I hope you know what is `site-packages`,
for I do not have time to explain this.
And I hope you can locate `site-packages` of PFC,
rather than `site-packages` of system default python.

Best wishes!
